# Data Modeling 
The data modelling process was undertaken to create a logical structure for the data, enabling it to be 
analyzed and visualized effectively.

# Dashboard Creation 
Identify the KPIs, design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard, and have interactive visualization and filtering capability 
to allow users to explore the data at various levels of granularity.

# Final Insights 
* Maximum attrition happening in the age group of 26 to 35.
* Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education i.e. 38% and Laboratory Technician as job role.
* Attrition directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, more chance of attrition.
* Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in company.
* Also average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab having higher chances of attrition.
